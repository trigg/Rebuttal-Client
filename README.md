# Rebuttal Electron App
Rebuttal Client is a multimedia webchat system featuring text channels and Voice, Webcam and Livestream rooms. It is written in JS/HTML and is used to connect to [Rebuttal Webchat servers](https://github.com/trigg/Rebuttal/) via Electron. 


## Installation

Install this repository and run `yarn client -- --url=https://127.0.0.1:9000/ipc` in the root. Naturally change the url to point to a running IPC URI on a server


## Customisation


### Themes
[See Wiki](https://github.com/trigg/Rebuttal/wiki/Theme-Creation)



## Using


### Sending images in text chat


#### Mouse & Keyboard

When viewing a text room Drag-and-Drop the image over the app. A preview should appear above the text input box. To cancel the upload press the red 'x'

#### Touch screens

Honestly I have no idea.
